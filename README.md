## Key Insights from the analysis

The data reveals key insights into workforce demographics, performance, and departmental contributions. Gender distribution is relatively balanced across most departments, with males slightly outnumbering females in areas like IT and Engineering, while HR, Finance, and Marketing exhibit a more equitable gender split. However, the "Other" gender category remains underrepresented, highlighting potential gaps in inclusivity efforts. Education levels indicate a workforce largely dominated by employees holding Bachelor’s degrees (50%), while those with advanced degrees (Master’s and PhDs) form a smaller proportion, suggesting a focus on mid-level qualifications. Performance trends reveal that the 31-40 age group performs the best, reflecting a balance of experience and energy, while younger employees (20-30) show lower performance, likely due to their limited experience.

From a departmental perspective, Marketing stands out as the top-performing and most project-intensive department, followed by Finance, Operations, and IT. Customer Support has the lowest performance scores, suggesting potential challenges that may require attention. Salary analysis indicates that higher-paying roles, such as Managers and Engineers, align with higher levels of responsibility and specialization, while entry-level roles like Technicians and Analysts earn the least. These patterns highlight opportunities for improvement in underperforming areas, better inclusivity efforts, and tailored strategies to enhance performance and engagement across age groups and departments.


## Recommendations

- Enhance inclusivity by fostering a diverse hiring process, promoting workplace diversity initiatives, and creating a supportive environment to attract and retain talent across all gender categories.

- Offer targeted training, mentorship, and structured onboarding programs to enhance the skills, productivity, and career growth of employees in the 20-30 age group.

- Improve performance in underperforming departments like Customer Support by providing targeted training, allocating resources, enhancing employee engagement, and addressing specific challenges through tailored interventions.

- Ensure even workload distribution in project-heavy departments like Marketing by leveraging technology and fostering cross-functional collaboration to prevent burnout and sustain high performance.

- Acknowledge and reward the achievements of high-performing departments like Marketing and Finance by sharing their best practices and offering performance-based incentives to sustain motivation and drive similar success across all teams.

# GROUP 4 PROJECT

## DATA ANALYSIS OF USA APPROVED LOAN DATA

## Team Members

- Oyenike Oyedokun
-  Adedayo Samuel Ojege
- Adeniran Ayodeji John
- Barakat Hamzat
- Elizabeth Odoh 

## OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle after a thorough evaluation of various options proposed by team members. Ultimately, we selected the USA Approved Loan Data as it allows us to apply all the data analysis tools we have learned and generate data-driven insights for existing loan companies, prospective entrepreneurs in the loan industry, and potential borrowers. Given the unique nature of the dataset, it was essential to fully understand its content to ensure accurate analysis and visualization. To achieve this, we familiarized ourselves with financial and accounting terminologies and dedicated considerable time to studying the dataset dictionary and thoroughly reviewing each column.

## DATA ANALYSIS TOOLS

- Microsoft Excel

- Microsoft PowerBI

## DATA ANALYSIS PROCESS

The dataset underwent extensive cleaning and preprocessing using appropriate data cleaning functions in Microsoft Excel. Calculations, including percentages and interest rates, were performed, and additional columns were created to provide clearer insights into the dataset. Queries were conducted to identify key trends and patterns within the data. 

The cleaned dataset was then imported into Microsoft Power BI for further transformation and analysis. Each column was reviewed for completeness and consistency, and any discrepancies were addressed. Various measures and visualizations were created in Power BI to extract meaningful insights, with the visuals categorized into four sections: summary, Risk Analysis I, Risk Analysis II, and Risk Analysis III.
